Pipeline Design Pattern
===

The Pipeline design pattern, also known as the Pipes and Filters design pattern, is a powerful tool in programming. The idea is to chain a group of functions in a way that the output of each function is the input of the next one. The concept is similar to an assembly line where each step manipulates and prepares the product for the next step 1.

The main idea behind the Pipeline pattern is to create a set of operations (pipeline) and pass data through it. The main power of the Pipeline is that it’s flexible about the type of its result 2.

Here’s an example implementation of the Pipeline pattern in C#:

```cs
public interface IPipe<T>
{
    T Process(T input);
}

public class Pipeline<T>
{
    private readonly List<IPipe<T>> _pipes = new List<IPipe<T>>();

    public Pipeline<T> Register(IPipe<T> pipe)
    {
        _pipes.Add(pipe);
        return this;
    }

    public T Process(T input)
    {
        T result = input;
        foreach (var pipe in _pipes)
        {
            result = pipe.Process(result);
        }
        return result;
    }
}

```
In this example, we define an IPipe interface that represents a single stage in the pipeline. The Pipeline class contains a list of pipes and provides methods to register new pipes and process input data by passing it through each pipe in the pipeline.

You can use this implementation to create pipelines that process data in multiple stages. For example, you could create a pipeline that reads data from a file, processes it, and writes the result to another file.
