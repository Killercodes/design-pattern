Prototype Pattern
===

The Prototype pattern is a creational pattern that allows you to create objects by cloning existing objects, rather than by creating new ones from scratch. This pattern can be useful when you need to create many objects with similar properties, or when you want to avoid the overhead of creating a new object each time one is needed.

The Prototype pattern involves creating a prototype object that serves as a template for creating other objects. The prototype object contains the basic structure and properties of the objects that will be created. To create a new object, you simply clone the prototype object and then modify the clone as needed.

One advantage of the Prototype pattern is that it can help to improve performance, especially when creating many objects with similar properties. Cloning an existing object is typically faster than creating a new one from scratch, because the basic structure and properties of the object are already in place.

Another advantage of the Prototype pattern is that it can help to simplify code and reduce redundancy. If you have many objects that share the same basic structure and properties, you can create a single prototype object and then clone it as needed, rather than duplicating the same code over and over again.

One potential downside of the Prototype pattern is that it can be more complex than simply creating new objects from scratch, especially if the prototype object has complex properties or requires complex cloning logic. Additionally, if the prototype object is modified after clones have been created, it can lead to unexpected behavior in the cloned objects.

Overall, the Prototype pattern can be a useful tool for creating objects efficiently and reducing code duplication, but it should be used carefully and with an understanding of its potential limitations.


## Points

- The Prototype pattern is a creational pattern that allows you to create objects by cloning existing objects, rather than by creating new ones from scratch.
- To use the Prototype pattern, you start by creating a prototype object that serves as a template for creating other objects.
- To create a new object, you clone the prototype object and then modify the clone as needed.
- Cloning an existing object can be faster and more efficient than creating a new object from scratch, especially when creating many objects with similar properties.
- The Prototype pattern can help to simplify code and reduce redundancy by allowing you to create a single prototype object and then clone it as needed.
- The Prototype pattern can be useful in situations where you need to create many objects with similar properties or where you want to avoid the overhead of creating a new object each time one is needed.
- The Prototype pattern can be more complex than simply creating new objects from scratch, especially if the prototype object has complex properties or requires complex cloning logic.
- It is important to understand the potential limitations of the Prototype pattern, such as the potential for unexpected behavior if the prototype object is modified after clones have been created.

## c#
an example implementation of the Prototype pattern in C#:
```cs
using System;

// Prototype interface
public interface IPrototype {
    IPrototype Clone();
}

// Concrete prototype class
public class ConcretePrototype : IPrototype {
    private string _name;

    public ConcretePrototype(string name) {
        _name = name;
    }

    public IPrototype Clone() {
        return new ConcretePrototype(_name);
    }

    public string GetName() {
        return _name;
    }

    public void SetName(string name) {
        _name = name;
    }
}

// Client code
class Client {
    static void Main(string[] args) {
        ConcretePrototype prototype = new ConcretePrototype("Prototype");

        ConcretePrototype clone1 = (ConcretePrototype)prototype.Clone();
        Console.WriteLine("Clone 1 name: " + clone1.GetName());

        ConcretePrototype clone2 = (ConcretePrototype)prototype.Clone();
        clone2.SetName("Clone 2");
        Console.WriteLine("Clone 2 name: " + clone2.GetName());
    }
}

```
In this example, the IPrototype interface defines the Clone method that is used to create a copy of the object. The ConcretePrototype class implements the IPrototype interface and provides a concrete implementation of the Clone method. This class also has a private field _name that can be modified by the client code.

The client code creates an instance of the ConcretePrototype class and then creates two clones of this object using the Clone method. The first clone is an exact copy of the original object, while the second clone has its _name field modified. This shows how the Prototype pattern can be used to create objects that are similar to existing objects, but with some modifications.

## Javascript
an example implementation of the Prototype pattern in JavaScript:
```js
// Prototype interface
class Prototype {
  clone() {
    throw new Error('Abstract method called');
  }
}

// Concrete prototype class
class ConcretePrototype extends Prototype {
  constructor(name) {
    super();
    this.name = name;
  }

  clone() {
    return new ConcretePrototype(this.name);
  }

  getName() {
    return this.name;
  }

  setName(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

// Client code
const prototype = new ConcretePrototype('Prototype');

const clone1 = prototype.clone();
console.log(`Clone 1 name: ${clone1.getName()}`);

const clone2 = prototype.clone();
clone2.setName('Clone 2');
console.log(`Clone 2 name: ${clone2.getName()}`);

```
In this example, the Prototype class defines the clone method that is used to create a copy of the object. The ConcretePrototype class extends Prototype and provides a concrete implementation of the clone method. This class also has a name property that can be modified by the client code.

The client code creates an instance of the ConcretePrototype class and then creates two clones of this object using the clone method. The first clone is an exact copy of the original object, while the second clone has its name property modified. This shows how the Prototype pattern can be used to create objects that are similar to existing objects, but with some modifications.

## Python
here's an example implementation of the Prototype pattern in Python 3:
```py
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Prototype interface
class Prototype(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def clone(self):
        pass

# Concrete prototype class
class ConcretePrototype(Prototype):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self._name = name

    def clone(self):
        return ConcretePrototype(self._name)

    def get_name(self):
        return self._name

    def set_name(self, name):
        self._name = name

# Client code
if __name__ == '__main__':
    prototype = ConcretePrototype('Prototype')

    clone1 = prototype.clone()
    print(f'Clone 1 name: {clone1.get_name()}')

    clone2 = prototype.clone()
    clone2.set_name('Clone 2')
    print(f'Clone 2 name: {clone2.get_name()}')

```
In this example, the Prototype class defines the clone method that is used to create a copy of the object. The ConcretePrototype class extends Prototype and provides a concrete implementation of the clone method. This class also has a _name attribute that can be modified by the client code.

The client code creates an instance of the ConcretePrototype class and then creates two clones of this object using the clone method. The first clone is an exact copy of the original object, while the second clone has its _name attribute modified. This shows how the Prototype pattern can be used to create objects that are similar to existing objects, but with some modifications.
