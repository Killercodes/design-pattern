Aggregator Microservices `Architectural`
===
The Aggregator Microservices design pattern is a way to manage complex data structures by treating them as dynamic objects with properties. This pattern is useful when working with data that has a flexible schema, such as JSON or XML documents. In this pattern, a service receives a request, then makes requests of multiple services, combines the results and responds to the initiating request


Aggregator Microservice invokes multiple services to achieve the functionality required by the application.

> Aggregator Microservice collects pieces of data from various microservices and returns an aggregate for processing.

## Intent:
The user makes a single call to the aggregator service, and the aggregator then calls each relevant microservice

Here is an example of the Aggregator Microservices design pattern implemented in C#:
```cs
public class AggregatedResult
{
    public DataA DataA { get; set; }
    public DataB DataB { get; set; }
}


public class DataA
{
    public string Property1 { get; set; }
    public int Property2 { get; set; }
}

public class DataB
{
    public string Property3 { get; set; }
    public bool Property4 { get; set; }
}

public interface IServiceA
{
    Task<DataA> GetDataAsync(int id);
}

public class ServiceA : IServiceA
{
    public async Task<DataA> GetDataAsync(int id)
    {
        // Implementation for retrieving data from service A
		return new DataA(){ Property1 = "A", Property2 = 1 };
    }
}

public interface IServiceB
{
    Task<DataB> GetDataAsync(int id);
}

public class ServiceB : IServiceB
{
    public async Task<DataB> GetDataAsync(int id)
    {
        // Implementation for retrieving data from service B
		return new DataB(){ Property3 = "A", Property4 = true };
    }
}


public class AggregatorService
{
    private readonly IServiceA _serviceA;
    private readonly IServiceB _serviceB;

    public AggregatorService(IServiceA serviceA, IServiceB serviceB)
    {
        _serviceA = serviceA;
        _serviceB = serviceB;
    }

    public async Task<AggregatedResult> GetAggregatedDataAsync(int id)
    {
        var resultA = await _serviceA.GetDataAsync(id);
        var resultB = await _serviceB.GetDataAsync(id);

        return new AggregatedResult
        {
            DataA = resultA,
            DataB = resultB
        };
    }
}

//main
	var serviceA = new ServiceA();
    var serviceB = new ServiceB();
    var aggregatorService = new AggregatorService(serviceA, serviceB);

    var result = aggregatorService.GetAggregatedDataAsync(1);

```

In this example, the AggregatorService class represents a service that aggregates data from two other services, IServiceA and IServiceB. The GetAggregatedDataAsync method receives an id parameter and uses it to make requests to both services. The results from these requests are then combined into an AggregatedResult object and returned to the caller.

The IServiceA and IServiceB interfaces define a single method, GetDataAsync, which takes an id parameter and returns a task that represents the asynchronous operation of retrieving data. The ServiceA and ServiceB classes provide concrete implementations of these interfaces, with logic for actually retrieving data from their respective sources.

In this example, we create instances of the ServiceA and ServiceB classes, then pass them to the constructor of the AggregatorService class. We then call the GetAggregatedDataAsync method on the aggregatorService instance, passing in an id value of 1. The result of this method call is an instance of the AggregatedResult class, which contains the aggregated data from both services.
