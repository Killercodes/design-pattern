Code For The Maintainer
===

## Why
- Maintenance is by far the most expensive phase of any project.

## How
- Be the maintainer.
- Always code as if the person who ends up maintaining your code is a violent psychopath who knows where you live.
- Always code and comment in such a way that if someone a few notches junior picks up the code, they will take pleasure in reading and learning from it.
- Don't make me think.
- Use the Principle of Least Astonishment.
