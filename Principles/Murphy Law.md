Murphy's Law
===
> Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.

It seems to be a universal law that when there is even the smallest possibility of something going wrong, it eventually will go wrong. It makes total sense when we think about probabilities and an infinite amount of trials. The law also applies to software development.
