Avoid Premature Optimization
===

Quoting Donald Knuth:
> Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.

Understanding what is and isnâ€™t "premature" is critical of course.

## Why
- It is unknown upfront where the bottlenecks will be.
- After optimization, it might be harder to read and thus maintain.

## How
- Make It Work Make It Right Make It Fast
- Don't optimize until you need to, and only after profiling you discover a bottleneck optimise that.
