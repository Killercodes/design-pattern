**KISS `"keep it simple stupid"`**
===

Keep the code simple and easily understandable. This principle guides you to write code that is easy to read and maintain.

> Most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complex.

## Why
- Less code takes less time to write, has less bugs, and is easier to modify.
- Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
- It seems that perfection is reached not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.

Some tips to accomplish this:
- **Keep the method small (less then 40 lines)**
- **Give meaningfull names to your methods and variables**
- **Don't abuse the comments , makethe code understandable without the need to comment everything**
- **Make methods to solve small problems. Divide the problem in small parts.**
