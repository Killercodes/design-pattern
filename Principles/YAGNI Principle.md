**YAGNI `"you aren't gonna need it"`**
===

Do not add any functionality in your code until it becomes really necessary to have it there. This principle guides you to avoid including funcationalities in oyur code that you think will be necessary in the future, but has no use in the present. 

> YAGNI stands for "you aren't gonna need it": don't implement something until it is necessary.

## Why
Any work that's only used for a feature that's needed tomorrow, means losing effort from features that need to be done for the current iteration.
It leads to code bloat; the software becomes larger and more complicated.
How

Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them.
